<h3> The Tomorrow War </h3>
<h4> 2021 ‧ Action/Sci-fi ‧ 2h 18m</h4>
<p> In December 2022, biology teacher and former Green Beret Dan Forester fails to land a job at a prestigious research center. While he watches the 2022 FIFA World Cup final, soldiers from the year 2051, through a time portal, arrive to warn that humanity is on the brink of extinction due to alien invaders: the Whitespikes. In response, the world's military are sent to the future, but less than 20% manage to survive, prompting a global draft. Dan receives the draft and is fitted with a bracelet that tracks him. Dan's wife Emmy asks him to remove the bracelet with the help of his estranged father, James Forester, but Dan becomes angry with him for abandoning him in his childhood and leaves without removing the bracelet. Dan and the draftees are sent to Miami Beach, Florida in the future, but few survive, having been dropped at the wrong location, high above the city.</p>

<p>Command orders the remaining recruits to rescue the staff from the nearby laboratory. The team discover the lab staff dead, but recover their research before the area is bombed. Dan and the survivors make it back to a military camp in Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, where Dan learns that Command is actually his daughter, Colonel Muri Forester. She asks him to accompany her on a mission to capture a female Whitespike, which are rarer than the males. They find and capture the female, only to have the Whitespike males descend on her position. </p>

<p>Muri finally reveals to Dan that in the past, he became disillusioned after failing to get his research job, which led him to divorce his wife and abandon his family, much like James did to him as a child. He then died in a car crash when Muri was sixteen. Dan and Muri are transported to the Jumplink located on a fortified oil platform in the middle of the ocean. They work on a toxin that can kill the female; however, the Whitespikes attack the base. </p>

<p>Muri is badly injured and asks Dan to take the toxin to the past, as humanity was never going to make it in this timeline, and they reconcile. Dan manages to return to the past with the toxin to mass produce it and attempts to give the toxin to the military so it can be sent back to the future, but learns that the Jumplink is offline, having been destroyed by the Whitespikes.</p>

<p>After explaining to his wife what happened in the future, they deduce that the Whitespikes did not arrive during the year 2048, but much earlier. Dan and Dorian investigate the Whitespike's claw with Charlie and discover fragments of volcanic ash from a volcano in the Changbai Mountains. They theorize that Whitespikes were already on Earth and global warming caused their release when they thawed and emerged from beneath the polar caps. He turns to the military for aid, but without proof, they cannot support him. He asks his father to transport an 8-man team. Dan leads a mission to Severnaya Zemlya in northern Russia to test his theory and finds an alien ship in an ice sheet. </p>

<p>Once inside, they realize that the alien ship is not actually a Whitespikes ship, and that the Whitespikes were cargo for the deceased alien crew. They inject the toxin into the dormant Whitespikes and this kills those injected but awakens the remaining Whitespikes. Dorian and Hart decide to sacrifice themselves by manually detonating the alien ship once they realize it is the only method of containment, but the female manages to escape. Dan and his father track down the female and manage to kill her, preventing the future war from occurring. Dan reunites with his daughter and introduces her to her grandfather. </p>
